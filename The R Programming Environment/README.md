  # Overview and History of R
  
# What is R

R is the dialect of the S language

R is a programming language frequently used for statistical analysis, visualization and other data analysis.
R is based on another programming language named S. In the 1970s, John Chambers created S for internal use at Bell Labs, 
a famous scientific research facility. In the 1990s, Ross Oaxaca and Robert Gentleman developed R at the University of Auckland, 
New Zealand. The title R refers to the first names of its two authors and plays on a single- letter title of its predecessor S. 
Since then, R has become a preferred programming language of scientists, statisticians and data analysts around the world. 
R is accessible, data-centric, open-source and has an active community of users.
R is what's known as a data-centric programming language. It's specifically designed to make data analysis easier, 
more efficient and more powerful. Another awesome thing about R is that it's open source. Open source means that the 
code is freely available and may be modified and shared by the people who use it.
